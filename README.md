#warped-tour-bands

This is a ruby script to grab information about the bands on Warped Tour and turn it into something that applications can be built out of.

##To-Do

There are currently some bugs:

* Need to create special cases for "!"
* Neck Deep isn't working for some reason?
* Test SQL!
* Make some database optimizations
* Do one of the below!

##Possible Applications

I original made this so I could sort through the bands and only see those bands that are playing on the date that I was going to, but here are some more applications:

* Android app (seriously, why is there an iPhone app, but not an Android one?)
* Band planner (allow users to "add" a band to their "to see" list that will be available on tour dates)
* Webpage to filter/sort bands

##Made With

Made with nokogiri, ruby, pizza, and pop punk by [Andrew Kerr](http://www.andrewjkerr.com).
